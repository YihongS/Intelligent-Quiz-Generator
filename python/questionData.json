[{"Question_type": "SA", "Question_id": 5, "Question_text": "In a math class activity, students are trying to invent the formula to calculate the area of a square while also contrasting it with calculating the area of a rectangle and triangle.

The \u201cMax-welfare\u201d design pattern suggests that when learners need to be paired for peer-tutoring over multiple sessions, for maximizing the learning gain in each session they should be paired with the partner they are most likely to learn from in that session.
