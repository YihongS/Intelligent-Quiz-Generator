That is, his practice might not be focused on the part that needs improvement, there is no feedback on his performance from experts.", "Rajiv may not know the optimal techniques for drawing because of a lack of explicit instruction, he has no supervision in terms of mistakes that he's making and he gets no feedback or remedial training for the components he's weak at.", "Rajeev is not improving because he is not undergoing deliberate practice. He is drawing alone, which means that one of the conditions of deliberate practice is not being met: he is not being supervised by a teacher to diagnose errors.", "Because he is neither given explicit instruction about the best method, nor supervised by a teacher to diagnose errors and get informative feedback and remedial training.

So while Rajeev is practicing a lot, he is not doing deliberate practice which focuses on correcting his errors and then improving his skill.", "There's no supervision of an external agent so no feedback", "People generally can't improve to a higher level without some figure telling them what that higher level is/looks like.

He may be unable to precisely diagnose his mistakes and/or to formulate an optimal plan to address them without supervision. Additionally waiting until the next day to address problems undermines his ability to relate errors to corrections and further removes his routine from deliberate practice.", "Dan is not receiving feedback from an external agent as such he may miss errors that he made that someone else might catch. He is also not receiving immediate feedback and both of these things are necessary for deliberate practice. In the options below, I have not selected \"No, because he is not able to practice corrections immediately\" as receiving immediate feedback is not the same as being able to practice corrections on that feedback immediately.", "No, because he doesn't have an external mentor to guide the practice.", "No, Dan is not engaged in deliberate practice because he is nothing supervised by a teacher to diagnose errors.

There is no external agent giving him feedback on what he is doing wrong and how to correct it. (corrective feedback). Some of the errors might not be visible to Dan and so it is important to get that feedback from an external agent like a teacher. 2. Remedial training is effective if it is taken immediately and not after some time of getting immediate feedback from an external agent.", "He did not get external feedback on tasks performance.", "Not exactly. To engage in deliberate practice, one must be given explicit instruction about the best method. Since Dan is simply reflecting on his own method and has never compared it with a best method given to him by an expert, this step is not met. You could perhaps argue that the second component of deliberate practice is met, he is his own teacher and diagnosis his own errors. But without the first point, this is meaningless. Finally, the third part of deliberate practice of getting informative feedback and remedial training could be argued that he's doing this for himself. But again, without being able to compare it with a best method, this is meaningless.", "No, since he receives no feedback on how well he does. Also, the feedback was not immediate.", "No, for he is not supervised and has no instruction from experts.", "No, because there is not an external agent providing instructive and immediate feedback in Dan's practice", "No because, he is lacking (1) explicit instructions about the best method (2) supervised by a teacher to diagnose erorrs because he s diagnosing them himself and (3) immediate feedback as he watched the videos at the end of the day and gives himself feedback", "Dan in this case is not able to practice his corrections at the time the errror is spotted. This is not ideal as golf is not a sport that strains the body heavily and thus, it is not the case unlike powerlifting or bodybuilding where the instance for deliberate practice has a limitation on the amount of activity. Additionally, Dan does not get feedback from an expert instructor. Therefore he may see far fewer errors than an instructor does.", "No, he needs external agent to give informative feedback, as he may be \"unskilled and unaware of it\".
