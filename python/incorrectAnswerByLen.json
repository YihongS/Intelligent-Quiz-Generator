[[1, "Even without deliberate practice, Rajeev could improve his skill by practice. If his skill doesn't improve at all, that is not a problem of deliberate practice, it's a problem that he didn't practice the same skill every day. He is not practicing a specific skill (draw the eye of the portrait). Although the lack of feedback is also important, it's more important to focus on the same practice)", "The task of creating a portrait is a complex one and should be studied step by step rather than in full. Hence, Rajeev should identify what parts of the portrait are problematic and practice them regularly instead of drawing new full portrait every day.", "lack of deliberate practice, to say, always practice a general and broad task set without pinpointing where exactly is not good.", "it's not deliberate practice"], [2, "Yes, he has isolated a specific task, practices it repeatedly and reviews his sessions to narrow on improvements."], [3], [4, "Yes indeed! The jigsaw method creates a growth mindset because through the process students are going through walks them through a process in which their own competence is demonstrated back to them and they are supported by the other students on their team. This translates to them feeling their own ability to succeed and increase their intelligence in the future.", "I think it does. Especially for those low-achieving students, Jigsaw enables them to learn from other members (in the expert group as well as Jigsaw group), knowing that they could also learn as well as their peers. Also, as Jigsaw team will rely on one another to learn that part of knowledge, each person will feel that they are making contributions.", "I think so. Because Jigsaw demonstrates to students that they can always learn from other people. What's more, it shows that they can not only learn themselves, but also help other people to improve together.", "Yes, because the Jigsaw methods let even the low-achieving students become expert and help other students. These students will feel they could also achieve better score if they work hard.", "According to the reading, Carlos changed his mindset because his groupmates think he was someone they could work with and someone they could appreciate.", "Yes, because it gives them the confidence that they can master a concept enough to teach others and help others do well when tested on that concept.", "Yes, students are encouraged to learn , express, they are seeing others rely on themselves and see themselves improve.", "Yes, for example carlos, have developed a growth-mindset, while he thought he was stupid he later think he is smart."]]
