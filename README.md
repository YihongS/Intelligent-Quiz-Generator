# TOLQuizGenerator

We host our code on github: https://github.com/YihongS/TOLQuizGenerator

## Where each of codes are:
The responses sorting function is written in Python, please find the main .py file in the "pyhton" folder.

The question retaking functions are written in Javascript, please find the main .js file in the "js" folder.

## If you want to change the questions and responce csv input, please:

1. Put your csv files (usually a question file and an answer file) under the "python" folder

2. Open the main.py file, change the file path to the path of your csv file in line 5 and line 64.

## Important note: 

Javascript doesn't allow scripts to read local JSON file. So please 

1. either try the prototype online (on the github server) 

2. or use a local host to run it (if you want to download the folder and change the csv file)
